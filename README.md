# Task-Scheduling-under-Mobile-Cloud-Computing-Environment
The python implementations of paper [Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment](http://www.mpedram.com/Papers/task-sched-MCC-cloud14.pdf)  

# Algorithm Overview
- Step 1: initial scheduling, without considering the energy consumption.
- Step 2: rescheduling to find the optimal one with least energy consumption under time constraint. 


# Implementation
- We use *class Node* to represent the node variables
- Two test samples are provided in the *main function*. One test samples is the same as the sample givin in the paper.
- Also, please refer **task scheduling.pdf** for more specific details.
  
  
Note: please refer this project if you want to use the implementation, thanks.
